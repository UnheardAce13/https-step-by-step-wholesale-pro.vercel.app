   # Install Puppeteer
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

3. **High error rates**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check API key configurations

4. **Memory issues during test**
   - Reduce concurrent batch size in config
   - Monitor system resources
   - Consider running shorter test duration

### 📞 Getting Help
